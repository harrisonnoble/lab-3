                    <p> Looking back to my network security controls, I would say my network is 
                    relatively secure compared to other home networks. Like I stated earlier, my 
                    network uses WPA-2 which has AES based encryption. Using these security measures 
                    with a strong password certainly would deter potential attackers who are looking to 
                    quickly get into poorly password protected networks. Another security strength I 
                    noted on earlier is my network firewall. Although I have not configured the firewall 
                    at all, the default rules do a good job in preventing potential attackers from pinging 
                    the network by dropping ICMP echo requests. Another strength of my network is that I am 
                    not running any servers or devices that need to face the public internet. Therefore, I 
                    do not have any forwarded ports on my gateway.</p>

                <Divider orientation="left">Network Weaknesses</Divider>
                    <p>One weakness of my network is that I do not have any DoS protection. Although 
                    my home network isnâ€™t very likely to experience a DoS attack, it is still a 
                    possibility to take into consideration. Because my network has no protections, 
                    even a small-scale DoS would probably be able to reduce or wipe out the network 
                    availability. Another weakness to note is the fact that Wi-Fi networks can easily 
                    be sniffed by people near or around your house. This means if you had a malicious 
                    neighbor, they could capture your network traffic. If this malicious neighbor 
                    captured the handshake done by devices and Wi-Fi routers, they could eventually 
                    crack your password given they put in the time and effort.</p>
